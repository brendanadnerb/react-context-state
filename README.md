This is a basic example of how I might put together an app with state managed via React context (vs. Redux or something else)
There are a few routes using [react-router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router), and a few fetches from a [JSON placeholder API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com).

## Running

(use NPM in place of yarn if you like...)

```
$ yarn install
```

then:

```
$ yarn start
```

This will run locally at https://localhost:3000/.

### Notes
